Odin Recipes Project

Goal:

This is project that I am attempting to create a website with links and pictures. HTML will be the only thing used for now. I will document things that I struggled with and things that did well. This is to hold my self accountable during my self-taught developer journey.

Skills I'll demonstrate:
    1. Basic HTML boilerplate. I will be writing this from memory and not using a template
    2. Structuring of Page
    3. Use of strong and em to emphasize importance
    4. Links
    5. Images
    6. Using git and becoming more familar with git/github

Challenge:

Create a Recipe website that will have multiple pages and images that works and functions properly

Ending:

Hopfully will be able to revisit this project after I start learning CSS and JS.
