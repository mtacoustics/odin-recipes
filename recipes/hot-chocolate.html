    <p>To make this authentic Mexican hot chocolate, you need Mexican hot chocolate tablets or squares 
        which gives it its unique taste. Eat the chile only if you can handle it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>½ Mexican hot chocolate drink tablet (such as Nestle® Abuelita®)</li>
        <li>1 dried red chile de arbol, lightly toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place milk and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and simmer, stirring, until chocolate is melted but not boiling, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour chocolate mixture into a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; blend until foamy. Pour into a mug. Break the chile 
            into 2 or 3 pieces, <br>discarding seeds, and drop into the hot chocolate. Drink immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's note:</h2>
    <p>To get the authentic taste, you need to use Mexican chocolate, which contains sugar and cinnamon. It gives the hot chocolate its specific taste. 
        I prefer to use 4<br> little squares of Rey Margo(R) chocolate, but it's not as easy to find here. You can also use 1/2 tablet Abuelita(R) chocolate 
        per serving.</p>
