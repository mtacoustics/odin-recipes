        <p>If you can make <em>boxed macaroni and cheese</em>, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, 
        and crispy bread crumb topping add some <strong>great extra</strong> flavor and texture.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese,divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pank bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup real bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. 
                Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. <br> Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't 
                stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the 
                Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
            <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives 
                and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
